bug fixes
Peter Verleegh: problem with double spaces?
add majus after hyphen
fix bugs in corrections made in final page (these corrections are not considered).
for Andrea Scharnhorst:
- see why Loet Leydesdorff is not separated by commas. Every noun should be comma separated after the "FullNameInvestigator" step.
- correct the detection of ambiguities so that "Almila, Salah Akda" and "Salah, Akda Almila" soient detectes comme semblables
- remove Andrea Scharnhorst from final check.
