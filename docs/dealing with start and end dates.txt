we have a map 1 of (author full name, pair(start date, end date)

we have a multiset of authors. 

we have a map 2 of (original author name, correct author name)

we have a map 3 of (correct fullname, corresponding correct author);

for each original author in map 2,
	create a set of strings
	add the full name of the curr original author
	finds its correct value if it is in map 1
	add the keys corresponding to this value if they are in map 1
	
	for each string in this set
		loop through their start dates in map 1, take the lowest
		loop through their end dates in map 1, take the highest
		
	get(correct value of fullname in map 3), which is an author
	udpate its start and end dates,
	put it in a new result set.	
		
	
	
	

OR

Create a map of all documents retrievable by Id: mapDocs(idDoc,Doc)
Create an empty  map of (fullNameWithComma, Pair<int,int)
Iterate through all ids
for each doc,
	for each author,
		substitute their fullNameWithComma by the fullNameWithComma in the map of Labels.
		retrieve the Pair of int corresponding to this new fullNameWithComma
		check max min for start and and date, put new values in the map
		reinput the doc in the map of Docs
		
Extract a Multiset of Authors from the map of Docs, create a map (idAuthor, Author)
	Update them with the map of <int,int>
	Update them with how many of them
