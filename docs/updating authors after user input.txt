We have a multiset of authors with just full names

We have a map of (fullnames with comma, corrected fullnames with comma)

Loop through the values of the map (the corrected names)
	for each of the corresponding key (the uncorrected names),
		take its count in the multiset,
		take its affiliation
		create a new author corresponding to these informations
		add this author to a new set (not multi).
		
		
loop through the multiset of authors,
			update their names by looking up the correct value in the map
			
loop through this multiset again,
			extract a simple set with count to "times cited"
